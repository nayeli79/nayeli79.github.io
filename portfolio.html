  <em> I'm currently participating in Girls Who Code. A great program to learn all about software and hardware computers. Thanks to the program I nows know a little about python (which i love) and about to learn Javescript. I'm also into photography. I take pictures of people (with their permission) and edit them. I love playing my cello a angelic sound it makes.</em>
